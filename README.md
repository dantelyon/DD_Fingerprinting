## MIRROR FP

Live code <a>here</a> (should work)

MirrorFP is a web-based fingerprinting tool for the purpose of personalization.

Built with React and CSS. I initially wrote the code in vanilla JS but ended up reworking everything to React because of all the client-side state involved.

The idea came to me when I was reading and learning about data analysis and web analytics. I came across many different terms and concepts, one of which was 'device fingerprinting' or 'browser fingerprinting'. I was intrigued. I learned more about fingerprinting and felt like it could make for a great project to learn more about it and about web analytics.

The first version was just intended to be showcasing all different types of fingerprinting techniques. It was only after working on the project that I further learned about personlization and decided to pivot the project in that direction.

The first thing I did was gather and read up on all the different ways and techniques one can fingerprint a user online. I wrote them all down.
I then looked up code for each and every technique. Some code worked, some code didn't, some techniques I couldn't even found any already-written code for. But for all techniques I had to do some degree of rewritting to better fit my needs.
This whole phase was a lot more difficult than I had anticipated. Mostly because of cross-platofmr incompatiblity, and because of having to figure out if a technique is worth it, if it provides any value, if it even works. Examples are font detection, plugin detection. And incognito detection (which I managed to create solutions for that worked across all browser vendors, but then, one day, the soluton I had for Chromium stopped working - I suppose they fixed that hole. I decided that I was not interested in playing the cat and mouse game.)

I learned A LOT of browsers and web APIs, and what one can do with browsers. And I als olearned a lot about privacy, and protecting the privacy of yourself as a user and the privacy of your users.

Creating the UI was the last part, and that started with me just creating a dark blue table which had all the data points. But I felt like the dark blue table felt out of place in comparison to the white background, so I gave the whole project a futuristic / space vibe. I am happy with it how it turned out and with the ambience.

I believe there is a lot of untapped potential with web analytics, especially in cooperation with segmentatiton and cohort analysis. I don't think online businesses are doing enough to better understand and accomodate their users. The one-size-fits-all model will be replaced, and already is to some extent.
