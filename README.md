## MIRROR FP

The project was created after learning about 'device/browser fingerprinting'. The first version of the project simply showcased all the different types of fingerprinting techniques that I had collected, both from research and from just thinking about this a lot. At some point in the research I learned about personalization and decided to pivot the project in that direction.
